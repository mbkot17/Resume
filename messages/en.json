    "description": "Lead SAP ERP/BI consultant in enterprise integration and automation with extensive experience in high-load retail landscapes.\n\nI take full responsibility for the end-to-end solution lifecycle: from gathering and structuring business requirements, systems analysis, and prototyping to estimation, planning, development of integrations and services, all types of testing (functional, integration, regression, performance), deployment, and production rollout.\n\nMy focus is on reliable and scalable integration solutions between SAP ERP, the POS landscape, and external systems: REST/SOAP APIs, message queues, IDoc, bgRFC, and event-driven approaches. I design asynchronous data flows with a focus on fault tolerance, data integrity, performance, and real-world operational scenarios.",
    "description2": "My core strength lies in systems thinking and engineering discipline. I build solution architectures from requirements to production: modeling target processes and interactions (BPMN, EPC, IDEF0/IDEF3), creating architectural and technical specifications, evaluating alternatives and constraints, and ensuring transparent documentation (Confluence, Swagger/OpenAPI).\n\nI place significant emphasis on quality and reproducibility: test automation, advanced Postman (collections, JavaScript-based auto-tests, monitors), CI/CD, monitoring, and alerting. I excel at bringing solutions to a production-ready state, including the optimization of performance, data, and integration processes.\n\nIn addition to enterprise projects, I develop practical web services and Telegram bots — ranging from rapid MVPs to integration services tailored to specific business processes, enabling quick hypothesis testing and reduced time-to-market.",
    "description3": "Systems analysis is a key competency: I have the ability to listen to the business, formalize requirements, define the target state, and guide implementation through to stable production operation."
